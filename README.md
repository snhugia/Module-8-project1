# Module-8-project1
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
  * For this project, I made a digital 12 and 24 hour clock. I made a menu that would appear as soon as the code ran and it promted the user to enter an input that would add an hour, minute, or second to the clock depending on what option was chosen.
- What did you do particularly well?
  * For this project, I believe the actual UI came out pretty well and the actual functionality of the program. I believe the code was written in a clear manner and executed as it should have.
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  * I could definitely have consolidated the if statements in each case making the code less repetative and I also could have improved the functionality of the clock because currently, the input needs to be entered twice in order for it to work.
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  * This project was pretty straightforward and I didn't encounter too many problems. I would say that writing the code for each case was the most complex and most time consuming.
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  * The skills that I aquired from completeing this project that would be transferrable would be maintaining simplicity and keeping the code clean and organized. For this project, I made sure to spend time on making sure the code was clean, made sense, and comments were added when necessary.
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  * I was able to do this by going over each line and reading it as if I was completely new to the project and thinking about if I would understand it had I not written it.
